# Migration from Firebase to Laravel API

This document outlines the steps taken to migrate the Daily Checklist application from Firebase to a Laravel API backend.

## Architecture Changes

1. **Directory Structure**
   - Created `/lib/laravel_api/models` for Laravel API-specific models
   - Created `/lib/laravel_api/providers` for Laravel API-specific providers
   - Kept Firebase models and providers for reference during migration

2. **Configuration**
   - Updated `config.dart` to specify API base URL
   - Removed Firebase configuration entries

3. **Provider Implementation**
   - Implemented base `ApiProvider` with HTTP methods and authentication
   - Created equivalent providers for each Firebase provider:
     - AuthProvider
     - UserProvider
     - ChildProvider
     - ActivityProvider
     - ChecklistProvider
     - NotificationProvider
     - PlanningProvider

## Migration Process

1. **Dual Provider Approach (Transitional)**
   - Initially implemented both Firebase and Laravel API providers
   - Created a toggle in `config.dart` (useLaravelApi) to switch between backends
   - Maintained parallel functionality during development
   
2. **Complete Migration**
   - Removed Firebase imports
   - Updated screens to use Laravel API providers directly
   - Removed conditional logic that checked which backend to use
   - Removed Firebase-specific code

3. **Updated Components**
   - Modified all screens to work with Laravel API models
   - Updated provider references in UI components
   - Adjusted model usage for Laravel API response structure

## Data Structure Differences

1. **IDs**
   - Firebase: String IDs
   - Laravel: Numeric IDs (managed as strings in Flutter)

2. **Dates**
   - Firebase: Timestamp objects
   - Laravel: ISO 8601 strings parsed to DateTime

3. **Relationships**
   - Firebase: Document references
   - Laravel: Foreign keys and related models

## Testing

Tested all functionality to ensure proper migration:
   - Authentication
   - User management
   - Child management
   - Activity tracking
   - Notifications
   - Planning

## Future Improvements

1. Complete integration of remaining providers:
   - Plan Provider
   
2. Optimize API calls to reduce server load and improve performance

3. Implement caching for offline functionality
